**Suricata HTTP fields** : Get Logs for Response and Request
**Feature Addition through Enrichment :**, But you can utilize more fields for alert conditions, prevent false positives
- Domain rank
- Domain category
- Domain creation date
- Have you seen that domain before?
- Reputation – File/Domain
- GeoIP information
- Autonomous System Number
- Randomness measure
- Vulnerability information
- User context
- Filename and hash
- Field Length
- Sources visiting same destination
***
**Important Asset and User Based Enrichment**
- Vulnerability scanners
- Asset database info
- Active directory : User/host properties, Group membership for user identified in event/alert, Physical location.

- [Image Matching Attributes Directly to Threat Intel]
- [Enrichment Example ]

**Tuning and False Positive Reduction**

**Alert Generation vs. Triage**
- If generation rate > triage rate, queue > 0
- If generation rate =< triage rate, queue = 0
***
**Automation vs. Orchestration**
- Automation : Setting up a **single** task to run with minimum human interaction
- Orchestration : Automated arrangement, coordination, and management of computer systems or software (multiple automated systems work together to get multiple steps of a larger process done)
	- For example, automation could be automating the looking up of an IP address on the abuseipdb.com database by the Cortex engine when using TheHive.
	- Orchestration, on the other hand, might be something like pulling IP addresses that were used by confirmed malicious virus samples, inserting them into the threat intel platform with sourcing details, blocking the IPs on the firewall, then emailing the firewall team of the action taken. Let's look at how this is done, and some of the common use cases
- **What Is SOAR?**
	- Each set of orchestrated steps called a playbook or runbook
	- Is this workflow a candidate for full, unattended automation? [image SOAR workflow]
- **Typical categories for SOAR:**
	- Enumeration and enrichment (IP, Hostname, Hash)
		- Using internal tool APIs
		- On external data
		- Resolved by SOAR framework
		- EX : Reputation, Threat intelligence matches, sandbox, User attribute, Device info, SIEM Search
	- Incident response
		- Blocking actions : 
			- C2 to malicious domain -> Push proxy block
			- Callback to IP address -> Push local/network block
			- Virus infection-> Push host isolation, user lock script
			- Spam email wave -> Push rule to block incoming mail
		- Sample gathering
			- Forensics tasks
		- Cleanup
#### If you don't have a SOAR tool

- **Kansa** 
	- Is a PowerShell-based incident response framework
	- Modules for : Netstat, autoruns, DNS cache, ARP, processes, services, users, prefetch, userassist, WMI, handles, and other advanced pieces of data.
**Alert and Case Management** [Image Alert and Case Management]
- **Input**
	- Creating new alerts in IMS from tool/SIEM alerts
	- All custom fields should be filled out for you
- **Investigation**
	- Enrichment of host, user, and attacker data
	- Adding observables to cases
	- Pushed from TIP when new observables found
- **Output**
	- Taking action based on closure codes
	- Re-image ticket, removal of observable from threat intel
**IBM Node-RED**
- A flow-based programming and automation framework
**DIY Scripting**
- Remember: SOAR tools have no monopoly on automation!
- SOAR is ultimately scripting with a GUI
- Anything done in a SOAR tool can be done in scripts
- PowerShell and Python are the most useful for analysts

### Containing Identified Intrusions
**Tools at your disposal**
- Network Containment
	- Physical: Can you find and unplug a device?
	- Link: Can you disable a switch port? Use isolated VLANs?, Create a DHCP reservation for the MAC as a non-routable IP
	- Network: Can you block the IP/Domain?
		- Firewall modification (Outbound blocking, Inbound block, Host or network firewall)
		- Router ACLs
		- Null routing (blackholing) traffic
		- DNS-based blocking
	- Transport: Can you block a port or other transport item?
	- Application: Can you stop a specific protocol or items within it?
		- DNS : Query, Response, Nameserver
		- HTTP : Domain/IP, Port, Protocol, TLS Details (Certificate, Connection Fingerprint), User-Agent, MIME, Referer, Reputation/Category
		- SMTP
			- Mail blocking can be based on: IP of sender, Domain, Sender address, Header Details, Mail Content, Attachment Content, Languages, Countries/Regions.
			- Possible actions : Move to user's junk folder, Delete the mail completely, Forward to security team, Identify as spam to recipient via header injection, Prefix subject line with text, Quarantine/remove files.
	- [Image Layers info]
- **Network-based**
	- Firewall rules and router ACLs
- Host-based: Firewall/IDS
	- Block travels with the device

**DNS**
1. **Response Policy Zones (RPZ) or "DNS Firewall"**
	- RPZ allows us to block malicious traffic at the DNS level
		- Effectively lies to client in the response
		- Can redirect or stop connection from occurring
	- The two most common uses for RPZ blocking:
		- Block all queries to a known bad domain
		- Block all responses containing a known bad IP
2. **Dynamic DNS Sites**
	- A free way to map any IP to a hostname
	- Easy to block based on parent domain : Example – deny all `*.dyndns.org`

**Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**
- Perfectly suited to stop inbound HTTP attacks

**Responding via Host and File-Based Containment Methods**
- Blocking Files/Executables
	- By hash, publisher, path, name or parent process, command line parameters
	- Tools : EDR, HIPS, Antivirus - custom signatures, Application Control (WDAC/AppLocker/3rd party), Exploit blocking (EMET-like tools).
- Network traffic blocking
	- Host based firewall (Inbound/Outbound) and By port, protocol, IP, or process
	- DNS/domain-based blocks : EDR/Windows Exploit Guard Network Protection, Hosts file, (Null routing (RPZ-style) blocking with OS)
