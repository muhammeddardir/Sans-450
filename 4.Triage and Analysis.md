### Alert Triage and Prioritization
**Alert triage is one of the analyst's primary jobs.**

**Defining "Dangerous" Types** : Attack near completion, In Kill Chain (Install, C&C, Objectives).
1. Exfiltration clues:
	- High-volume DNS tunneling
	- High volume traffic from unusual source
	- Long connection time to odd destination
	- Questionable compressed archive creation
	- Multiple port firewall denies outbound from a single source
	- DLP alerts, UEBA alerts
	- URLs with long unexplained parameters
2. Spotting Data Destruction Attempts : 
	- Compromise of patching servers
	- Compromise of high privilege accounts
	- Unrecognized GPO changes
	- Use of secure deletion or raw disk access
	- Known wiper family malware spotted
3. Sensitive Hosts, Users, and Data : 
	- Extra special alerts for all high-level admins, critical hosts, and sensitive data
	- Best if it relies on auto-updated list in SIEM
	- Requires something to keep list up to date
4. Targeted Attack Identification Opportunities
	- Specific IOCs
	- Files
	- Email
	- Actions : zero day

**Perception, Memory, and Investigation**
**Types of Memory :**
- Short-Term Memory (STM)
- Long-Term Memory (LTM)
**F3EAD Cycle :**
1. Find: Targeting the threats you will address : I.R
2. Fix: Identification of adversary on network : I.R
3. Finish: Incident response, taking action against adversary : I.R
4. Exploit: Gather ALL useful info from I.R. for threat intel : T.R
5. Analyze: Creating actionable intel, develop attack profile : T.R
6. Disseminate: Give info to interested parties, feedback to start : T.R

**Threat Intelligence Process Models**
- F3EAD
- Formal Intelligence Cycle
- Diamond Model

**David Bianco's "Pyramid of Pain1"**
**MITRE ATT&CK**

**When Each Model Applies**
- Triage: Which alert is most important? (Kill Chain, MAC)
- Incident Response:
	- What do I do next? (Incident Response Process)
	- What indicator to block? How to Block? (Pyramid of Pain)
- Defense Strategy/Audit: Threat Models and Attack Trees
- Hunt Team/Analytic Development: MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢
- Threat Intelligence: 3 levels, F3EAD
- Operations Tempo: OODA Loop

**Fighting Confirmation Bias with ACH :** "Analysis of Competing Hypotheses" fights confirmation bias
**Tools for Link Analysis: Maltego**

**Consider All of Your Sources of Host-Based Information**
- **What ran**
	- AV, EDR, HIPS
	- App. control tool
	- Sysmon process logs
	- Process creation logs
	- Powershell Logs
- **Why it ran**
	- Parent Process
	- Task List
	- Installed Services
	- Autoruns (ASEPs)
	- Scheduled tasks
- **Forensic Sources**
	- Prefetch
	- App Compatibility Cache
	- MUI Cache
	- UserAssist
	- Windows/ OfficeMRU (for files)
	- Memory forensics
**Alternative Sources of Information**
- IP assignments = DHCP
- Web traffic = proxy
- Logins = security log

**OSINT**
- **Operational Security (OPSEC)** : 
	- The process which gives a military operation or exercise appropriate security, using passive or active means, to deny the enemy knowledge of the dispositions, capabilities and intentions of friendly forces
	- Passive Searching
		- Make third party scan content as VirusTotal 
- Sites that keep OPSEC safe
- OSINT Scan or Search: Choose Wisely : VirusTotal, URL Scan, 
- Other important ways to keep yourself safe: 
	 1. Using an unattributed connection
	 2. Dedicated analysis desktops with burner VMs
	 3. [image keep yourself safe]
**Analysis OPSEC Summary**
- Do not prod attacker infrastructure without good reason
	- Use Passive DNS searches where possible
	- Utilize sandboxes with recorded responses for URL investigation
	- If you do interact with malicious infrastructure, use unattributed lines
- Keep IOCs/files to yourself unless told otherwise
- TLP tells you what you can share
- PAP guides what you can interact with

[Image Analytical Completeness]
**Closed Case Classification**
- Disposition: True/false positive, indeterminate
- Incident Type: Malware, Hacking, Insider Threat, etc.
- Time: To detect (dwell), assign, contain, remediate
- Initial Detection Source: FW, AV, IDS, external, etc.
- Device Types Affected: User Laptop, Server, ICS, etc.
- Attribution/Motivation: Group name/type, objective
- Summary: Bullet point style executive summary
