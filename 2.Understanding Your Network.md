### Network Architecture
- Network segments and subnets
- Traffic flow
- Points of visibility : as Mirror (SPAN) ports on a switch, Network tap on the wire
**To understand traffic visibility and flow, we must :**
- Understand how routers, switches, and firewalls assist us with visibility and traffic control
- Understand security zones
- How we implement them with access control/firewalling
**Next-Gen firewalls**
- Define access between all network segments
- Controls traffic Layer 2 through Layer 7
- Understand user identity and expected application behavior
- Firewalls are your centralized traffic control system
**The Future: Zero-Trust Architecture**
- The network is always assumed to be hostile
- Makes security asset- and identity-centric
**Defending a Flat Network** : Your network has no segmentation? You're not alone…
***
### Traffic Capture and Analysis
- Flow logs: Layer 3 and 4 only : 
	- Example: Captured by agent on routers, firewalls, or switches, as NetFlow, Jflow, NetStream, sFlow.
	- You'll receive session timing, how much data was transferred in each direction, the high-level protocol used, and the source and destination IP and port, but nothing much more specific than that.
- Service Logs: 
	- Zeek, Suricata, etc., Layer 7 - application metadata only
	- They will cut logs for HTTP methods, DNS requests types, hostnames, SMTP connection details and more, plus everything from the flow logs tools.
- Packet Capture: Full PCAP
	- Contains the actual data transferred, will have your answer.
***
### Understanding DNS
**DNS Server and Client Types :**
- Stub Resolver : 
	- Basic DNS client, Run by the host OS, USE to lookup for a hostname.
	- May or may not locally cache answers
- Forwarding Server : 
	- Caches answers but does not recourse
	- Your home router/domain controller/organization's local DNS Server
- Caching/Recursive Server : 
	- The server that will recurse up to the root nameservers to find the answer caches answers
	- ISP DNS server, OpenDNS, 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, pi-hole, etc.
**DNS Records** 
- Authoritative nameservers : 
	- Do not need to recurse to find an answer, know all names in their zone. No caching/recursing such as ns1.google.com
- **TXT Records :** 
	- TXT records are used whenever there is some bit of information about a domain that needs to be passed to a client over DNS protocol.
	- Used to associate arbitrary text with a hostname
	- Often used for spam prevention : SPF, DKIM
	- `RFC 1464 suggests = pair formatting`
	- **SPF :** Allow list of IP addresses or machines that are allowed to send email from that domain.
	- **DKIM :** DKIM is that you post a public key in a TXT record that will be used to sign all outgoing mail.
- **CNAME Records :**
	- A pointer from one host name to another
	- If you type "`sans.org`", can send you to `www.sans.org`
- **MX Records :**
	- MX records are used when an email is sent to a given domain, The answer it will receive is the hostname “mail.sec450.com”.
	- If you send email to sec450.com, for example, a DNS MX record lookup is performed by the server sending the mail to find out which host handles email for the remote domain
	- When sending mail :
		1. MX record of the domain is queried, Example: MX record for sec450.com = mail.sec450.com
		2. DNS “A” record lookup performed for the hostname in the answer
		3. SMTP connection established to that IP address
			1. MX record must contain an FQDN : FQDN must map directly to A record (CNAME not allowed)
			2. Lists a numerical priority for server selection (Lowest number is the most preferred server)
- **SRV Records :** Help clients find a service by name and protocol
- **NS Records :** Identifies name of DNS server, not IP address

### DNS Analysis and Attacks, EXERCISE 2.1: Exploring DNS

**DNS logging to make malicious DNS visible**
- How/where are you monitoring? Log files or network extraction?, Can you find the source host?
- Are you recording responses? Without responses, you will not know the IP resolution.
- Are you saving responses? Create your own PassiveDNS database!
**Connecting IP Addresses to Domains**
- Domain Reputation
- Domain Age
- Domain Randomness and Length
**DNS-Based Attacker Tricks**
1. **Unauthorized DNS server use**
2. **Malicious sites on shared hosting**
3. **Modifying your DNS records**
	- Domain shadowing Attack : Adding a new record in your zone that they can point at their own evil server
	- Transparently intercepting your organization's traffic! Attack :
		- Clone your orgs website on an evil server
		- Obtain a TLS cert for YOUR domain – they can if they control DNS
		- Clone your org's webpage, send your employees there, intercept data!
4. **DNS Tunneling**
	- CNAME tunneling and TXT record tunneling: [Image DNS CNAME tunneling, DNS TXT tunneling], [Page 73]
		1. The DNS request is being made by malware installed on the machine, not normal Windows programs
		2. And it is encoding whatever data it is sending into the subdomain (29b90180…). 
		3. Once the command is interpreted, a response can be returned that, although encoded, will make sense to the malware on the far side (bc590180…).
		4. Can Send Command as Subdomain Encrypted
	- Detecting DNS Tunneling/Exfiltration :
		- Excessive queries for one domain with many subdomains
		- Excessive DNS queries from one source
		- Excessive amount of odd query types : TXT, CNAME, MX, NULL
		- LONG/random looking subdomains
		- Encoded data in TXT responses
		- Usage of unauthorized DNS servers
		- False positives: CDNs, AV checks, DNS Hijacking tests
5. **Blockchain DNS** [Image BDNS]
	- In a Blockchain DNS system, if a company registers a domain (like example.com) on the blockchain, everyone can see and verify this registration. When a domain is updated or transferred, this change is recorded instantly and securely.
	- Attackers use DNS names Instead of using IP addresses in malware, 
		- so that if their servers are discovered and taken offline by authorities, they can simply point their command and control domain to a new IP address, 
		- Sometimes however, domains can be taken down as well when reports get to registrars that a domain is being used for malicious purposes, This would render malware disable, 
		- what's a criminal to do? ,One new option is to use a domain that can't be taken down By (Blockchain backed DNS "BDNS"), EX : EmerDNS 
		- There is one important exception, at least in the case of EmerDNS which is currently a commonly used blockchain DNS solution. The OpenNIC project maintains a peering agreement with EmerDNS1, so if a user is using OpenNIC's DNS resolvers to resolve DNS
		- Note : BDNS is just the domain to IP mapping, not the server itself
	- **Detect :** looking for DNS requests with any blockchain DNS (BDNS) root zones. 
6. **Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)**
	- Only characters supported in DNS hostnames are the characters "a-z", "0-9", and a dash.
	- Someone buy a domain name with Greek or Chinese characters?, to avoid this use punycode
	- **punycode :** This means if you had a Greek keyboard and typed in Καλημέρα.gr, that domain would first be converted into an alternate representation called the "punycode" encoding, which in that specific case would be "xn--ixahbwnhi5b.gr".
	- There are characters in non-English languages, EX, there is the Omicron (Ο).
	- **Omicron :** That means you could craft a domain name using it in place of an "o" (such as youtube.com) : 
		- Here are the three right next to each other, can you tell the difference?
			- О (Cyrillc)
			- O (English)
			- Ο (Greek)
	- Punycode Encoding Interpretation, Punycode encodes IDNs as ASCII strings [Img Punycode]
	- **Detect:** This is easy because all punycode encoded IDNs start with the special strings "xn--". 
	- Phishing with IDNs : **ᏚĖC450.com** = xn--c450-uva139z.com/, ḟacebook.com [IDN]
	- **Detect :** when search in **VirusTotal** by **ḟacebook.com** Result **xn--acebook-js3c.com (ḟacebook.com)**, this mean Ꮪėc450.com this is not sans domain is phishing
**The Future of DNS**
- DNS over TLS (DoT) –TCP Port 853 : easy to block
- DNS over HTTPS (DoH) – 
	- TCP Port 443, Sends request in JSON encoded, 
	- HTTP/2 format, TLS encrypted packet, 
	- Firefox/Chrome/Edge/Safari support is now available, 
	- Sends HTTP/2 request with MIME-type: application/dns-message
	- Potential responses for the Blue Team: 
		-  Decrypt – Using TLS inspection methods (this is the best answer)
		- Disable – Signal not to use DoH to clients with “canary domains”
		- Log – Use an internal DoH-capable server that records requests
		- Tell DNS client to log (Firefox can write a DNS log, for example)
- DNSSEC : Provides authentication and integrity, not confidentiality, Signs all responses with a server public key
***
### Understanding HTTP
**HTTP2**
- SPDY, pronounced "speedy," was a networking protocol developed by Google to enhance the performance of web pages.
	- Uses one TCP connection with numbered streams that contain frames
	- Sends separate HEADERS and DATA frames
	- Headers are binary on wire, not textual
	- Encryption required for all browser traffic, optional for others
	- Server push means that every file will not have an associated request
	- Divided Packets by header Called Stream Contain number of sequence packet. 
**HTTP3**
- HTTP/3 is here too and uses Google's "QUIC" protocol!, More of a revision of Layer 4 than Layer 7 (UDP traffic instead of TCP)
***
### HTTP(S) Analysis and Attacks, EXERCISE 2.2: HTTP and HTTPS Analysis
**HTTP is used for almost all Cyber Kill Chain phases:**
- Deliver/Exploit: Exploit Kits, Phishing, Fake Updates
- Installation: Malicious executables and scripting
- Command and Control: Periodic GET/POST
- Data Exfiltration: Encoded/Encrypted upload
**HTTP Analysis Methods**
- Automated methods:
	- URL and site reputation checks : Remember safe domain does NOT mean safe URL
	- Screenshots
	- Sandboxing sites
- Manual Methods:
	- Examination of headers : Request/response analysis
	- Examination of content : Content analysis, File extraction (By WireShark), Anomaly hunting (Check host Header if domain or IP).
- JA3, JA3S, and JARM TLS Fingerprints : TLS connections with slightly different parameters
***
### Understanding SMTP and Email, EXERCISE 2.3: SMTP and Email Analysis
**Email sending and delivery can be in 3 separate pieces** [Img Email Delivery Infrastructure]
1. Email submission from your computer to the SMTP server : MUA to MSA
2. MTA is Relay between the **source** email server and **destination** : MTA, MTA/MDA, Source organization/Destination organization
	- The source SMTP server receives the email from the MUA and begins to relay it
	- The source organization may have a series of MTAs the email goes through on its side, with the last one being responsible for transferring the email over the internet to the server listed in the MX record of the receiving organization.
3. Receiving the mail from the destination server : MUA

- Uses keywords for addressing Can Use Via Telnet [image SMTP Telnet]
	- EHLO [sending server name] 
	- MAIL FROM: `<sender email>`
	- RCPT TO: `<recipient email>`
	- DATA 
		- To, From, Subject 
		- [email body], "." to end
- Email Headers  [Img Components of a Received SMTP Message]
	- Trace headers  : Written by each MTA "Received"
	- Message headers : Written by client sending email or submission MTA (MSA), Contain message metadata
	- Body : Shows "plaintext" and HTML view of the email content, Attachments are usually base64 encoded
- MTA [Image Tracing an Email], [Img Interpreting A Received Header Line]
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWI1tC96djM : OSCP SMTP
- [image Spoofed Email Injection] : the sending organization's border MTA will verify that an email address is indeed a legitimate sender, It does this by forcing users to authenticate during the SMTP connection using the ESMTP extensions and AUTH LOGIN command.
- **Tracing an Email**
	- The Received Header : Answer in this Question "How can we tell what servers (MTAs) an email has bounced through as it made its way from sender to receiver, or even who sent it?"
	- Received Header Format : `"Received:" *received-token ";" date-time CRLF`, It is the token that we are most interested in for tracing headers.
	- After the mail client passes the email on to the submission MTA, the first received header is added on the bottom line.
	- "Received: from (source MTA and IP) by (receiving MTA and IP writing the header) ; [date]".
	- This means if we read the Received headers from bottom to top, if the email was no spoofed, we should see a continuous chain of matching received "from" and "by" hostnames and IP addresses. 
	- In [Image Tracing an Email], 
		- In Header at #2 which did not include "from" name of the host labeled in #1. This sometimes occurs with intermediate MTAs within an organization and is not cause for concern
		- The first received header shows the hostname of the device was "Lenovo" and its IP address at the time of sending was 10.20.30.40 (removed for space step #1) which had a DNS PTR record of static-40-30-2010.phlapa.ftas.verizon.net
		- The second stop this email makes is to the submission MTA at smtp.gmail.com.
		- Email left Google's border MTA and entered Microsoft's infrastructure
		- SMTP is a TCP protocol which requires two-way interaction and cannot be spoofed like UDP.
		- First Received header : this line is written by the receiving server as the email.
		- [img Interpreting A Received Header Line]
- Spoofed Email Injection
	- [img Email Spoofing] : Yes, the sending organization's border MTA will verify that an email address is indeed a legitimate sender, by forcing users to authenticate during the SMTP connection using the ESMTP extensions and AUTH LOGIN command, but attackers can bypass that process completely, A malicious email sender talks directly to the receiving organization's border MTA to pass an email that, if that receiving MTA has no way of knowing where that email came from as SPF to Verifying the Source of a Message and DKIM, it will believe the assertion in the headers of where and who it came from.
- SPF
	- SPF Check approved senders IP for domain, By DNS published list
		- EX for DNS published list : Approved senders for sec450.com: 1.1.1.1 = Allowed to send Everything else = Not allowed [image SPF Approved senders]
	- SPF Results :
		- Pass: The client is listed as authorized for sending email
		- None/Neutral: Either there is no policy listed, or the policy does not address the source specifically
		- Soft fail: Between neutral and fail, client is allowed, but should be treated as suspicious (when "~all" is used)
		- Fail: The client is listed as unauthorized for sending email, usually falls under "-all" rule
		- SPF Results are shown in two locations: Authentication-Results header, Received-SPF header
- Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) 
	- DKIM verifies email source via digital signatures
	- Takeaway: Look for dkim=pass in authentication-results header!
- DMARC
	- SMTP has other issues: From fields may differ from "Envelope" vs. "Content", DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to fix this
		- **Envelope From:** This refers to the sender's address used in the SMTP protocol during the email transmission. It is not always visible to the end user and is primarily used by mail servers for routing and delivery purposes.
		- **Content From:** This refers to the sender's address as displayed in the email client or the visible "From" field that the recipient sees
		- **The Issue:** 
- Tool : Mailhog
***
### Additional Network Protocols
- DHCP usage for defenders
- Protocols used for lateral movement/exfil
	- SMB
	- SSH
	- RDP/VNC
	- Powershell Remote
	- ICMP/FTP
	- Any remote access or administration tool, regardless of protocol
**DHCP for Defenders**
- Why is DHCP interesting?
	- Most incidents require mapping IP address to computer and Computer name can be used to find the device's owner
	- Can be used to detect rogue devices! (An attacker may try to sneak into a building and plug a device into the company network)
		- Hostname: Matching against naming pattern, deny/allow list
		- MAC Address OUI : Deny list: Wi-Fi routers, IoT devices, Allow list: Company authorized laptop vendors, etc.
- DHCP assigns a host a dynamic IP address using UDP

**Server Message Block: SMB**
- Used by the most dangerous exploits of the past : 9 Equation Group tools

**SSH**
- You can use that capability to send anything over the tunnel
- Outbound SSH = Inbound Tunneling
	- From a FireEye blog post: Bypassing Network Restrictions Through RDP Tunneling1
	- [image DNS Tunnling]
	- [Bypassing Network Restrictions Through RDP Tunneling | Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/bypassing-network-restrictions-through-rdp-tunneling)

**Remote Desktop Protocol/ VNC**

**PowerShell Remoting**
- Connects using port 5985 (HTTP)/5986 (HTTPS)
- [image powershell]

**FTP**
**Evil ICMP**
