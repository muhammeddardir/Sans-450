#### SOC Overview

**The Components of Security Operations :**
- **People :** Performing analysis and investigation, design and run processes
- **Process :** The defined sequence of events performed to achieve an end goal
- **Technology :** Hardware and software used to accomplish the mission

**Questions that will help you clarify your mission :**
- What are we trying to protect?
- What are the threats?
- How do you detect them?
- How will you respond?

**Level :**
- Highly critical: Application control, EDR/XDR, zero trust network design, strict email policies, etc
- Less Critical: Basic tools and data monitoring capabilities

**How to Secure :**
- Outbound FTP data transfer : 
- Inbound web status page : 

**The SOC at a High Level :** [Image 2]

**Organizing security team duties :**
- Core SOC Activities
	- Data Collection: What’s happening on the network/devices
	- Detection: Identifying items of interest from data collected
	- Triage and Investigation: Confirming and prioritizing detected issues
	- Incident Response: Responding to and minimizing the impact of attacks
- Specialty/Auxiliary Capabilities
	- Threat Intelligence: Collecting information to improve attack detection
	- Forensics: Supporting I.R. with deep research and reverse engineering
	- Self-Assessment: Inventory, config monitoring, vuln. assessment, Red Team, etc.

**Critical SOC Information :**
- Network diagram: Simplified version for easy reference
- Points of visibility: Taps and span ports, full PCAP
- Data flow diagram: How does traffic reach the internet?
- Log flow diagram: Where do logs come from/go?
- Incident response plan: What to do when things go wrong
- Communication plan: Who to inform, and when

**Documents Analysts Must Be Familiar With :**
- Policies: High level, broad, direction setting, mandatory
	- "All systems plugged into the network must have antivirus installed"
- Standards: Also mandatory, define how or how much
	- "Configuration settings for antivirus agents must be…"
- Procedures: Step-by-step instructions for a process
	- "How to install and ensure antivirus is working"
- Guidelines: Discretionary, suggested : actions/recommended procedures where actual standards and procedures do not exist
	- "Best practices for antivirus deployment"
- Baselines: Highly specific settings list (CIS benchmarks)
- Use Case/Playbook: SOC Specific prescriptive rules/procedures for detection
**Measuring and Communicating Your Activity with SOC Metrics :**
- Are derived top-down – Which specific requirement is that metric helping you track?
- Are actionable – Is there a threshold that is too high or too low? What will you do if that threshold is hit?
- Are well-defined/repeatable - If you ask two people to gather that metric, will they produce the same number?
- Are updated frequently/automatically – Any number you are tracking should not add hours of work to produce it, and should be updated quickly enough to react
***
#### Defensible Network Concepts
**What makes a network "defensible"? Difficulty**
- Monitored : Deploy Network Security Monitoring sensors capturing
- Inventoried : This means knowing what you host on your network
- Controlled : Ingress filtering, egress filtering, as network admission control, network access control, proxy connections, and so on
- Claimed : Owners of services known, operation of assets planned
- Minimized : work with stakeholders to reduce the attack surface of their network devices, as clients, servers, applications, network links
- Assessed : This is a vulnerability assessment process to identify weaknesses in assets
- Current : Patched and known vulnerabilities addressed
- Measured : SOC and IT measure progress against previous steps

**The types of data monitoring required for security (Sides of Monitoring)**
- **Network-based security monitoring (What Can You See on Your Network?)**
	- bandwidth, Ports, protocols, applications (being Accessed), domains, Full Packets data.
	- Network Security Monitoring (NSM) : Analyzing network traffic (May be logged by an endpoint, or network sensor)
	- Monitoring Data Sources Overview : Network extraction (Zeek), Routers and switches, Network firewalls, IDS/IPS/NDR, Proxy, WAF, Service logs (DHCP, HTTP, FTP and so on)
- **Endpoint and Application monitoring**
	- what command line arguments were used? installed Program/Run script
	- What exploits is the system vulnerable to?
	- Have any critical system files or configurations changed?
	- Do any systems have suspicious startup items?
	- Who has been logging in to the system and how?
	- Continuous Security Monitoring (CSM) : Typical endpoint data – "data at rest"
	- Endpoint collection sources : 
		- Security suite logging : EDR, XDR, Antivirus, HIDS/HIPS, Vuln. Scanner, FIM.
		- Operating System & Application Logs : Authentication logs, Service and process logging, Autorun items, Application access and audit logs.
	- Monitoring Data Sources Overview : Authentication logs, Antivirus, HIDS/HIPS, EDR, Process command line, Executables, Vulnerability scanners, DLP, Application access logs, Application Audit logs
- Cloud monitoring
	- How do we log them?
		- Execution logs : Function as a service (FaaS) (serverless)
		- App logs : Software as a service (Saas)
		- Platform logs : Platform as a service (PaaS)
		- Host logs : Infra as service (IaaS)
	- Cloud svc. plane logs : Management plane (AWS, Azure, GCP account and service usage).

**Monitored data centralization concepts**
- Formatting different data types for centralization
***
#### Events, Alerts, Anomalies, and Incidents
- Defining events, alerts, and incidents
	- Events: Any observable occurrence in a system or network
	- Alerts: An event of interest that may be unwanted or unauthorized
	- Incidents: A violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices
- Two Types of Alerts
	- Known-bad signature match/IOC list-based : More likely to be dangerous, addressed first in most cases
	- Anomaly-based alerts : Lower fidelity, more time required, but also may catch unknown attack types
- Flow of event logs vs. alert logs
- Considerations for event and alert collection

***
#### Incident Management Systems
- SOC Data Organization : 
	- Alert queueing and active incident tracking, Updating threat intelligence, Log data management, Automation of investigative actions, Code repositories, Unstructured data storage
- Tools for SOC Data Organization and Search :
	- Incident Management System (IMS)/(SIRP) : Tracking alerts, incident status and associated indicators, IMS receives alerts/incidents, creates a case in ticket queue, Cases assigned to analysts, features as Playbook-oriented workflow, EX: TheHive Open Source.[Image IMS, IMS.2], **EXERCISE 1.1**: TheHive Incident Management System
	- Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) : Collection of indicators and higher-level intelligence info
	- SIEM
	- SOAR
	- Knowledge Database/Source Code Repositories
- Incident Categorization Frameworks : 
	- VERIS : Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing : Classification : 
		- Actor: Whose actions affected the asset? (External)
		- Action: What actions affected the asset? (Malware)
		- Assets: Which assets were affected? (Hosting)
		- Attributes: How was the asset affected? (Confidentiality/ Possession)
	- US-CERT : Incident Reporting System Categories
		- Functional: "No impact" to "DoS/Loss of Control"
		- Information: "No impact" to "Destruction of critical system"
		- Recoverability: "Regular" to "Not recoverable"
		- Attack Vectors : Web, Phishing, Ext. Media, Impersonation, Improper Usage, Theft, etc.
		- Incident Attributes : Location of Observed Activity
***
#### Threat Intelligence Platforms
- **Intelligence :**
	- Taking in external information from a variety of sources and analyzing it against existing requirements in order to provide an assessment that will affect decision making.
	- Examples : Weather Report: Do I need to bring a coat today?
- **Threat Intelligence :**
	- Combination of intent, capability and opportunity.
		- Intent : is a malicious actor’s desire to target your organization
		- Capability is their means to do so (such as specific types of malware)
		- Opportunity is the opening the actor needs (such as vulnerabilities, whether it be in software, hardware, or personnel)
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence :** 
	- "Threat intelligence is the analysis of adversaries – their capabilities, motivations, and goals; and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is the analysis of how adversaries use the cyber domain to accomplish their goals."
	- NOT just a list of bad domains and IP addresses
	- Analyzed cyber threat data giving a strategic and tactical advantage over the adversary
	- Definition themes: Human analysis required, Identify TTPs and goals of threat actor, Output drives decision making.
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms and You EXERCISE 1.2: MISP Threat Intelligence Platform**
	- Self-Hosted, Free: MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform), OpenCTI
	- Commercial: Palo Alto XSOAR TIM, LogRhythm TLM, ThreatConnect, CrowdStrike Falcon X, Recorded Future, IBM X-Force Exchange, Anomali ThreatStream
