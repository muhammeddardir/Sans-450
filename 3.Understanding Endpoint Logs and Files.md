### Endpoint Centricity

**Many important steps of an attack are endpoint-centric :**
- Exploitation
- Code Execution
- Persistence
- Information Discovery: Accounts, files, privileges
- Privilege escalation
- Lateral movement
- Data collection and preparation for exfiltration

**KillChain :** Delivery

**Service-Side Exploits**
- Requires an accessible, listening port : Web, SMB, VNC, RDP, Firewall must allow traffic

**Client-Side Exploits**
- Does not necessarily involve any network traffic as "Open this Word document", "Click this link in my email"

**Post-Exploitation Tactics**

**Privilege Escalation**
- User Privilege > Local Admin > Multiple Host Admin > Domain Admin

**Abusing Operating System Permissions**
- Hijacking admin startup items
- Modifying service executables
- Unquoted paths
- DLL search order hijacking
- Modifiable scheduled task

**Kernel Exploitation**
- Leverage kernel vulnerabilities to run arbitrary cod

**Credential Access via Dumping :**
- Admin user can read memory or registry keys
- Allows an admin to become another user

**Mimikatz**

**Lateral Movement with Mimikatz**
- Many remote administration protocol choices : 
	- CLI : SSH, SMB w/PSExec, PowerShell remoting, WMI
	- GUI : RDP, VNC, X11 forwarding
**Exfiltration**
- Finding a Way Out : Mail, Proxy

### Endpoints Defense In Depth

- **Exploitation:** Networking Scanning, Vulnerability Scanning, Inventory, Patching, Anti-Exploitation (EMET/Exploit Guard), Windows Credential Guard (Prevents tampering with critical processes (LSASS.exe))
- **Installation:** Hardening, AV, FIM, PAWS, App. Control
- **C2:** Host firewalls, HIDS/HIPS
- **Actions:** Auditing, UBA (UBA/UEBA), Encryption, Logging, DLP

**Catching Persistence**
- Autorun items
- Malicious services
- Scheduled tasks
- Browser extensions
- Valid account credentials

**Privileged Access Workstations (PAWS)** : Provides a strong foundation of a secure device, a compromised device undermines all downstream items such as jump servers and accounts used

### How Windows Logging Works
**Windows Log Breakdown**
- Level: Information, Warning, or Error?
- Source (Provider): What program wrote the log?
- EventID: Unique number for event type
- Task Category: Additional description of event
**Two Sections of Windows Logs – System and Event/UserData**
- In the Windows Event Viewer, clicking on the details tab for a message and selecting the XML view shows the two sections each log event is broken into
- **System :** will be present for every event log that is made.
- **Event/UserData :** These fields are defined by the program writing the log and may change for every single event ID and application writing a log. Many of these fields are used to create the "message" view seen in the General tab.
**PowerShell**
- `Get-WinEvent -ListProvider * | Select name`
- `$provider = Get-WinEvent -ListProvider Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing //This commands sets the provider to the Windows Security Log`
- `$provider.events | Where-Object {$_.id -eq 4624} | select id,template,description | fl //This command selects event id 4624 and dumps the ID, Template (pictured above), and the description` 
- Putting the Pieces Together (System XML + EventData XML)
- **USB Plug and Play Events :** Event ID 6416

### How Linux Logging Works
- SYSLOG 514 : Format `<time> <hostname> <log_source> [<PID>]: <message>`
- Syslog daemon – Rsyslog, syslog-ng, syslogd, etc.
- Logging Facility and Severity Levels [Image Facility and Severity]
- Traditional Linux Log Path : Log Messages > Syslog Daemon > `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/messages`
- Common Linux Log Files to Collect [Image Linux Logs Paths]
- **Systemd Journal** : A newer method of Linux logging to fix syslog pains, systemd-journald is a system service that collects log data `/var/log/journal/[machineid]/`, `journalctl -u suricata`
- **To audit process creation :** `auditctl -a exit,always -F arch=b64 -S execve -k proc_create`
	- OR `sudo apt install snoopy`

**Kerberos Authentication and Ticket Granting Service**
- [Image Kerberos Authentication Visualized]
- Windows records these events in the Security Channel : [Image Kerberos Log Events Map]
	- 4768 : A Kerberos Authentication Ticket (TGT) was requested
	- 4769 : A Kerberos service ticket was requested
	- 4770 : A Kerberos service ticket was renewed
- During the initial authentication step when a user first logs in, the event ID 4768 will be recorded on the domain controller. 
	- If the request ends in success and the user receives the ticket, the result code of 0 will be returned
- Not all logins use Kerberos; how can you tell which was used?
- Anytime Kerberos is used, the Key Length will be listed as 0 as this is not a relevant field for Kerberos authentication.
- The caveat is that it is possible to have a 0-length key field for NTLM as well. 
- **When Authentication throw network in event id 4624, 4625 add failed "Network information" contain Authentication Package : NTLM or Kerberos**
- [image The Logging Pipeline]
- [Image Log Collection Methods]
- [Image Windows Log Collection Options]
- **Unstructured Logs :** Syslog/device logs
- **Structured Log Formats :** 
	- Comma Separated Value : `192.168.1.1,8.8.8.8,55001,53,udp`
	- Key-Value Pairs : `source_ip=192.168.1.1, destination_ip=8.8.8.8,`
	- JSON : `{ source_ip: "192.168.1.1", destination_ip: "8.8.8.8"}`
**SIEM Centric Formats**
- CEF: Common Event Format
	- Contains source device info in pipe-delimited section, key-value message
- LEEF: Log Event Extended Format (QRadar)
	- Similar to CEF – syslog header, pipe-delimited info, then key-value pairs
- Why Structure Is So Important
	- Structure makes parsing fast and reliable
	- Parsing must work for a SIEM to index the fields
	- If the SIEM cannot extract fields for indexing, only full text search will work, which is sloooow
**Log Enrichment and Correlation**
- **What is log enrichment?** : Adding information to a log that wasn't there originally, Used for giving context that helps interpret the log.
- Log Generated > Collect > Parse > Normalize > Enrich > Index > Store.

### File Contents and Identification
- What is a file really? Just a sequence of bytes
**Files**
- Linux Commands : file, Hexdump, sandbox/dynamic analysis
- Magic Byte to identify file
- Forensics File Tools
- Unicode and Encoding
	- Unicode : 
		- Code points are expressed as “U+__” - Example: A = U+41
		- Conversion of code points to bytes in a file is determined by the encoding
		- Common encoding schemes: ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32
	- Encoding :

### Identifying and Handling Suspicious Files

**How can we safely transport malicious files?**
1. Don't want accidental clicking 
2. Don't want AV finding and deleting 
3. Don't want to endanger others who find it later
**Which File Types are Potentially Dangerous?**
- Executables, Scripts, Documents (e.g. Rich Text Format (.rtf)) and Other (Icons, pictures, video, fonts, email and more)
**Miscellaneous Files as Exploits**
- CVE-2018-8475: Remote code execution if user views a picture
- CVE-2018-1010: Remote code execution through viewing a font 
- CVE-2010-2568: LNK vulnerability used by Stuxnet
- CVE-2020-1349: Code execution if use views an email in Outlook preview!

**Quickly Sorting Good from Bad**
- Online hash lookup
- Check for digital signatures by tool `Sigcheck -a -h -v filePath`
- Visual inspection of the document
- Strings: Look for scripts where they shouldn’t belong
- Scripts: Obfuscated/random variable names?
- The ultimate: Sandbox test – what does it do?
